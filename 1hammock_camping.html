        <h3 class="section-bullet">Overall Information:</h3>
        <p>
            I am going to recommend you look through <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/shugemery" target="_blank">shugemery's</a> YouTube channel for different hammock reviews.<br>
            This guy gives great information and shows off different hammocks with a lot of know-how.<br>
            He has different playlists for reviews, hammocks, types of hammocks, and so much more. Plus he's funny.
        </p>

        <h3 class="section-bullet">Backpacking Hammock:</h3>
        <p>
            My hammock choice brand is <a href="https://www.warbonnetoutdoors.com" target="_blank">Warbonnet Outdoors</a>.<br>
            My hammock is the Blackbird XLC series.<br>
            I payed for the lightweight double layered because I read that if you are sleeping without a sleeping bag and you have a single layered hammock that mosquitoes can bite through your hammock.<br>
            I also think I got a 'headbox' or something for mine, it might just come with the hammock but it is a storage area inside the hammock. I can't imagine not having mine.<br>
            Again shugemery has a lot of information on different brands and hammocks so go check it out if warbonnet is too expensive or just not for you.<br>
            <br>
            No matter what hammock you get, you should find tree straps for your suspension option as they are less harmful to trees and just as durable as any other option.<br>
        </p>

        <h3 class="section-bullet">Tarp / Cover:</h3>
        <p>
            I also got my tarp from <a href="https://www.warbonnetoutdoors.com" target="_blank">Warbonnet Outdoors</a>.<br>
            My tarp is the thunderfly, which is pretty pricey for a tarp.<br>
            The reason I purchased such an expensive tarp is because when you buy backpacking gear (as opposed to camping gear) you are paying for long lasting but lightweight material.<br>
            A cheaper tarp will add MUCH more weight to your pack and again you are welcome to come check out my gear and see for yourself how light it is.<br>
            As long as you get a hammock tarp designed for backpacking it doesn't really matter what you get.<br>
            I decided to splurge on a more expensive one because of how much I knew I would use it.
        </p>

        <h3 class="section-bullet">Underquilt:</h3>
        <p>
            Honestly, unless you are camping in winter weather; the underquilt you choose doesn't matter too much.<br>
            You do need to have one!!! But I bought a Wise Owl brand, cheapest that I could find, underquilt that does the trick.<br>
            If you buy cheap, it is going to be heavier and for backpacking the lighter your stuff is the easier your hikes will be.<br>
            If you have the money it is worth buying a down underquilt, down is way lighter, warms better, breathes easier if it's to hot, blah blah...<br>
            The Warbonnet Wookie quilt matches with the hammock perfectly and is very lightweight and perfect but quite pricy.<br>
            <br>
            For temperature rating make sure you read my sleeping bag info on the recommended page.<br>
            Anything around 20°F or 0°C should be good for most temperatures and screw winter camping.
