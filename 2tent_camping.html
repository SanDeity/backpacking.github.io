        <h3 class="section-bullet">Tent:</h3>
        <p>
            Sharing a tent with another person can reduce overall group weight and keep each other a bit warmer.<br>
            You can also look into tents that use your own hiking poles as the supports.<br>
            The tent Ben borrowed worked like that and takes maybe a minute max to set up.<br>
            <br>
            I don't have a lot of information on tents since I move to hammock camping many years ago.<br>
            Just keep in mind you are looking for either a 1 person or two person BACKPACKING tent.<br>

            might have some info on tents as well, but I really only know his hammock content.<br>
            I also recommend browsing different reddit posts when looking for a backpacking tent, people share a lot of good info there that you won't see in reviews or on the website.

            is a fairly cheap "2 person" tent that Ben borrowed from Jason.<br>
            Using hiking poles to prop up the tent is convienient and easy to set up, and you don't have to carry poles.<br>
            I would probably buy this tent if I weren't above the ground-sleeping peasants.

        <h3 class="section-bullet">Sleeping Pad:</h3>
        <p>
            This is an important one. A lot of ultralight backpackers use the fold up sleeping pads.<br>
            I don't know what the heck is wrong with them but it's just not worth destroying your back when you can sleep on an inflatable pad.<br>
            This is one of the areas that you should carry a little extra weight to make your trip more enjoyable (like bringing a hammock setup)<br>
            If you can sleep happily on the ground with just a foam pad, more power to you I guess.<br>
            <br>
            <a href="https://klymit.com" target="_blank">Static V by Klymit</a> is an excellent, durable pad for backpacking.<br>
            This is what both Carter and Ben borrowed for our trip.<br>
            I don't know of their other sleeping pad products but an insulated static V should be all you ever need for a tent backpacking sleeping pad.<br>
            If you want to go a less quality but cheaper route any inflatable sleeping pad marketed for backpacking would be fine.
