        <h3 class="section-bullet">BOOTS (and cats):</h3>
        <p>
            This is maybe the most important thing to spend big money on.<br>
            There are a bunch of good brands out there, if you can try on boots at some place keep an eye out for Oboz, Merrell, and Kuru.<br>
            They say a pound on your feet is like 5 on your back, so a lot of people buy lightweight shoes.<br>
            <br>
            I LOVE <a href="https://obozfootwear.com/en-us" target="_blank">Oboz</a> brand boots.<br>
            I've worn mine for over 5 years, as everyday footwear and hiking boots.<br>
            The same pair I wear over to a friends house today is the same pair I took to Hawaii idk how many years ago.<br>
            Yeah I probably need a new pair by now but it's amazing they have lasted this long.<br>
            Also I should mention when you get them and if you treat them every year or so, they are virtually waterproof.<br>
            My mother slipped and submerged her entire foot, but her feet stayed dry.<br>
            <br>
            <a href="https://www.kurufootwear.com/?srsltid=AfmBOorUaZN3LpUfz26EM3FuvpA1adGf1tPmeMxAa-6QPvDhUnfEJ0S3" target="_blank">Kuru</a> 
            is a pretty good brand of shoes as well, but I have not worn any.

        <h3 class="section-bullet">Backpack:</h3>
        <p>
            Really the only thing to do for a good hiking bag is make a trip to REI or similiar hiking 
            specific store where an employee can fit you for a bag and you can load it up and walk around the store with it.<br>
            Everyone seems to have their own preferences when it comes to bags but all that really matters is you get a real bag that fits you, 
            not some cheap walmart one that doesn't have the correct supports or whatever.<br>
            A real bag will have it's own water protective cover and adjust to fit your size (not every bag adjusts to all sizes though).<br>
            It might also be worthwile to bring your tent and or sleeping setup to make sure they fit in the bag, 
            although as long as you don't get a tiny ultralight bag most should fit your sleep setup.<br>
        </p>
        <h3 class="section-bullet">Sleeping Bag:</h3>
        <p>
            Look for any backpacking sleeping bag that fits your dimensions.
            <br>
            When it comes to rating, I don't recommend you buy the lowest temperature possible, and the same goes for your sleeping bag.<br>
            Anything around 0°C - 30°C for comfort level should be fine (if it doesn't specify look for -10°C as the lower number).<br>
            My bag is rated for comfort: 5°C - 40°C, and for extreme temp -15°C - 5°C.<br>
            If you ever plan for winter camping, you basically need mostly new gear anyway so I don't recommend trying to use the same bag for both.<br>
        </p>
        <h3 class="section-bullet">Apparel:</h3>
        <p>
            For backpacking apparel it is also up to your own preference.<br>
            The most common way to pack is to bring 1 good hiking shirt, 1 good pair of hiking pants, and then multiple base layers of clothing 
            (socks, underwear, underarmour and the such).<br>
            Trial and error for your preferred clothing.<br>
            <br>
            More important is a good light weight rain jacket (columbia brand maybe), and a down puffer for night time.<br>
            My down puffer packs neatly into a small bag and fits inside any side pocket of my bag which is really convienient.<br>
            Frequently it is much colder at night than expected so it's just smart to have an extra lightweight down jacket to keep you alive.<br>
            <br>
            Gotta have a hiking hat too, necessary for long hikes in the sun.
        </p>
        <h3 class="section-bullet">Other:</h3>
        <p>
            Quickfire other things you should own.<br>
            <br>
            Water filtration system. <a href="https://www.sawyer.com/category/water-filtration" target="_blank">Sawyer filters</a> work fine and are durable, 
            although a hand pump is just so much easier to use. Quality of life upgrade.<br>
            <br>
            Get a head lamp.<br>
            <br>
            A backpacking knife is pretty useful<br>
            <br>
            There are tons of cooking options, but all you should ever need is a multi-utensil and a <a href="https://jetboil.johnsonoutdoors.com/us" target="_blank">Jetboil</a>.<br>
            The Jetboil has a range of products and most work fine but ideally you should get one with the stove attachtment and that packs in neatly.<br>
            <br>
            Most hikers insist you own a GPS system, although is is quite pricy.<br>
            Along with navigation, a firestarter, a backpacking first aid kit, and tent patch kit can save your trip or even your life.<br>
            Most first aid kits also have an emergency foil blanket, if they don't you might consider adding one.<br>
            <br>
            This is basically everything you NEED to bring on a backpacking trip.<br>
