        <p>
            Hello gamers, this is a comprehensive list of my personal recommendations and a checklist for you to begin your backpacking lifestyle.<br>
            You may not wish to move out into the wilderness and live off the land yet but this is a good start.<br>
            <br>
            <a href="https://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/backpacking-checklist.html" target="_blank">This link</a> 
            will take you to a basic checklist and is what I start with when I begin packing for a trip.

            IMPORTANT NOTE:<br>
            Everything that you look to buy is going to be more expensive when you purchase the 'backpacking' version.<br>
            This is because backpacking items are going to be much lighter weight and more durable.<br>
            You are paying a premium for long lasting, light weight, quality supplies.<br>
            You may choose to go the cheaper route on some items but every extra pound makes the trip MUCH harder and it really adds up.<br>
            The rule of thumb is 20% of your body weight in your pack. Many people take weighing packs very seriously and every pound you can eliminate honestly helps a lot.

        <h2 class="section-header">Hammock VS Tent Case Study</h2>
        <p>
            Here's the rundown pal: Hammock backpacking is superior in pretty much every way. I'll make a little pro / con list for you though.<br>
            <br>
            Pros:<br>
            Hammock isn't on the ground - consistantly comfortable sleeping EVERY TIME.<br>
            It's worth mentioning twice because a bad night's rest can ruin a trip: COMFORT!<br>
            No tracking dirt into the tent, or having to remove your shoes to look through your stuff<br>
            Flooding is a non-issue. PERIOD.<br>
            You look cooler than all the peasant ground sleepers.<br>
            <br>
            Cons:<br>
            Setting up a hammock can take longer, but obviously it's worth it. You remember hanging out under my tarp. That was cool.<br>
            It is easier to stay warm without open air below ya bum.<br>
            I'm not sure the safety a tent OR a hammock provides when camping in bear country, but a tent does FEEL safer...<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Side notes: Some say that a hammock is more susceptible to the weather. The truth is that tent and hammocks face different challanges with the weather.<br>
            For example, with proper knot tying; my hammock and tarp withstood 'tornado' level winds that collapsed Jason's tent in a downpour.<br>
            Who can say whether it was the wind or rains, but they had to take shelter in my parents tent for the night as theirs collapsed and flooded. I however was safe and sound.<br>
            The struggles a hammock faces are that everything will be colder, since you have ventilation underneith as well as above.<br>
            With a properly rated sleeping bag and underquilt, this is no issue.<br>
            We were both pretty cold at our last trip but it was pretty manageable for Juno and I. I can't speak for you though.<br>
            Also being cooler is a plus when camping in summer!<br>
            <br>
            My final argument for hammocks: If weight or comfort is your concern, there are a wide range of hammocks for different weight ranges and heights.<br>
            It's also important to note that an everyday hammock is not designed for sleeping in, and does not represent real hammocks.<br>
            They are only about 8-9 feet long and don't have a ridgeline.<br>
            My hammock is 11 feet long and is designed for people up to 6'6'', with a maximum weight rating of 350lbs.<br>
            You are MORE than welcome to come over sometime and lie around in my hammock if you are considering getting one.<br>

            <br>
            <br>
            Regardless which you choose, I have recommendations for both. A hammock setup would cost more but there are a lot of factors in play.<br>
            Check out the top of the page for Hammock recommendations and more info, or tent recommendations and more info.<br>
            Also recommendations for all necessary gear are in the final tab.<br>
